        <h1>Brownie Fudge</h1>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>90 g (3 oz) dark chocolate, coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>100 g (3 1/2 oz) butter</li>
            <li>3/4 cup (150 g) sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 compact cup (100 g) brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 eggs and 1 yolk, beaten together</li>
            <li>2/3 cup (100 g) wheat flour</li>
            <li>3 spoons cocoa powder</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F). Grease a square 18 cm (7 in) mold. 
                Line the base with baking parchment.</li>
            <li>Mix the chocolate and butter in a heatproof bowl. Place the bowl over 
                a pan of simmering water and let it melt. Remove from heat and let it cool.
            </li>
            <li>Mix both sugars with the chocolate mixture along with the vanilla extract. 
                Gradually integrate the egg mixture, beating continuously. Add the flour 
                and cocoa and mix until completely combined.
            </li>
            <li>Pour the mixture into the prepared mold. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until 
                it rises but is still slightly soft in the center and when a wooden toothpick 
                is inserted into the center, it comes out with some moist crumbs and looks 
                cracked.
            </li>
            <li>Let it rest in the mold for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack and let 
                it cool completely. Cut into squares.</li>
        </ol>
